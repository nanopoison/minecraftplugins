All of these plugins were created for the LNHS Band Minecraft Server.

I have only just learned how to make minecraft pluggins. It's been about 5 days now, I'm still learning. If anyone wants to learn with me, you can always hit me up! I'm down to
work with everyone!!!

If you want to help me create any plugins please let me know in the "pluginstuff" category on the discord!

*** NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY ***

Thanks!
